Chunk's Challenge Level Format
------------------------------

Four bytes:
	1st byte: level width (must be >=10)
	2nd byte: level height (must be >=10)
	3rd byte: length of name
	4th byte: length of password

Name in bytes, until the specified length is read

Password in bytes, until the specified length is read

One byte representing the length of the hint

Hint in bytes, until the specified length is read

Tiles in bytes, until width*height is reached.
These are read and written in columns.
	File: (for a 3x4 board)
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

	Board:
	0 4 8
	1 5 9  etc...
	2 6 10
	3 7 11

One integer is the endian marker.
This should be 0x12345678.

Attributes are read until the end marker (0xFFFFFFFF).
They are written in this way:
	One integer containing the tile:
		first 2 bytes: x
		second 2 bytes: y
	One integer containing the attribute value.

	Example:
	0x0001 0001 0xF34D0012

	Board:
	0 0 0
	0 A 0 ("A" spot (1,1) has attrib. 0xF34D0012)
	0 0 0

Finally, there is one integer containing the following:
	( nr_of_chords shl 16 ) or nr_of_notes

One short containing level's time.
